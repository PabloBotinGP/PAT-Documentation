# Introduction

This documentation defines the **annual data update process** for the PAT (Procurement Analysis Tool) Master DataBook. 

## What is PAT?

The **Procurement Analysis Tool (PAT)** is NREL's comprehensive platform designed to simplify utility-scale energy procurement for organizations of all sizes. Whether you're a commercial buyer, local government, university, utility provider, or regulator, PAT helps you navigate the complex landscape of off-site ?renewable? energy procurement with data-driven insights and scenario planning capabilities.

PAT empowers users to:

- **Explore energy opportunities** across the United States, including land-based wind, solar, and battery storage technologies.
- **Compare procurement pathways** such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Utility Sleeved Tariffs.
- **Run scenario simulations** across multiple sites to evaluate the best energy solutions for your organization.
- **Access personalized results** tailored to your specific goals, experience level, and risk tolerance.

**Before diving into the data update process**, we strongly encourage you to explore PAT at [https://pat.nrel.gov/](https://pat.nrel.gov/) and create your own energy procurement scenario. Understanding how the tool works and what data ultimately powers these analyses is crucial for maintaining intentionality throughout the data collection and integration process. When you see firsthand how users interact with PAT's features—from technology insights to downloadable resources—you'll better understand the quality and precision required for the underlying Master DataBook that supports these capabilities.

How to use this documentation.. 



The process must be followed every year to ensure the DataBook and the tool remain **accurate, consistent, and up to date**. It is not just a one-time effort, but a recurring workflow that requires discipline and documentation at every stage.  

At a high level, the process includes:

- **Data collection** — identifying and gathering new datasets and reports from recurring and ad-hoc sources.  
- **Data cleaning** — evaluating, pre-processing, and standardizing the information.  
- **Data integration** — updating the Master DataBook and producing clean CSV outputs for use in the PAT tool.

## Frequency

The update cycle is performed **once per year**.  

Throughout the year, useful information should still be collected and stored in the “Current Data Collection” folder. At the end of each year, the formal update process begins, during which all collected material is cleaned, reviewed, integrated, and delivered to Jill for ingestion into the tool.  

Additionally:
- Sources that publish on a **regular basis** (e.g., LevelTen quarterly reports, annual EIA releases) must be tracked and listed in this documentation.  
- Sources that publish **spontaneously** should also be noted and integrated into the workflow when relevant.  

The intent is to make each annual update as smooth as possible by maintaining an ongoing collection effort, then consolidating and integrating the data during the yearly update window.
