This section covers periodic updates to the **State** and **PPA_National&BA** tabs.

## State — Electricity Choice Type

- Open: [Retail Energy Choice — Energy choice in your state](https://www.retailenergychoice.org/energy-choice-in-your-state/#info)
- The page contains **two interactive maps**. Use **“Electric Choice in your State”** to verify each state’s status.
- For each state, confirm that the status in the **State** tab matches the map. Update if necessary.

**Allowed values**
- `Restructured`
- `Partially Restructured`
- `Not Restructured`

**Checklist**
- [ ] Visited the map and verified all states  
- [ ] Updated **Electricity Choice Type** where discrepancies were found  
- [ ] Saved changes and updated the change log (date, initials, scope)

> Tip: If your process also maintains **Electric Choice Links** or **Customer Segment Eligibility** in the State tab, review them while you’re there to avoid multiple passes.
