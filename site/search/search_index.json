They are distinct from standard regulated utilities in that:</p> <ul> <li>Standard utilities typically own or operate the distribution system and have obligation-to-serve responsibilities for customers within their service territory.</li> <li>Competitive suppliers do not generally own the local wires; instead they offer retail supply contracts, pricing, and services to customers in restructured markets where customers can choose their supplier.</li> </ul> <p>Because competitive suppliers operate only in markets with retail choice, their coverage and identifiers (such as names and IDs) are typically reported at the market or state level rather than by local distribution territory. In the PAT Master DataBook, the Competitive Suppliers tab contains the list of these suppliers.</p> <p>Update Approach</p> <p>Updating Competitive Suppliers is generally more straightforward than some other tabs because the primary source \u2014 the EIA's EIA-861 data (Schedule 4B) \u2014 is published in a consistent format each release. That means the file layout rarely changes and updates can be handled by replacing the existing tab with the latest schedule export.</p> <p>Note: historically Competitive Suppliers did not always include an <code>EIAID</code> value, but recent EIA-861 releases include EIA identifiers for suppliers. This is helpful because we can use <code>EIAID</code> as the key for matching and de-duplicating records.</p> <p>Steps</p> <ol> <li> <p>Primary source: EIA-861 Schedule 4B</p> </li> <li> <p>Download the Competitive Suppliers / Retail Power Market sales schedule (Schedule 4B) from the EIA EIA-861 page:     https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/</p> </li> <li> <p>The Schedule 4B file is consistently formatted each release.

Use this tab to add newly discovered utilities, correct names or IDs, and maintain contact/territory information.</p> <p>The State tab serves a similar purpose for state-level attributes: electricity choice status, average price references, official links, and customer-eligibility notes.
